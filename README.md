# Gavekort.no

For our webshop [gavekort.no](www.gavekort.no) we will offer a oneÂ­stop shopping experience for gift cards from multiple vendors.
We do not wish to keep any local stock of physical products, but will dispatch orders to each vendor. 
Gift cards may be shipped as physical cards or as a gift code by email PDF attachment. 
One single customer will be able to shop many different gift cards from different vendors, 
to different recipients, with multiple shipping methods.

The visitor must have a smooth shopping experience, hiding all the complexity with multiple orders, 
gift messages, forwarding payment to each sub vendor etc.

## Technology

We have chosen to extend Magento through custom extensions based on Unirgy uMarketplace Suite 
for the multi vendor functionality and uGiftCert for the gift card functionality.

See [project spec](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20080302/Develop%20Magento%20extensions%20for%20multi-vendor%20gift%20cards%20%28update%20may%203rd%29.pdf)
for more details.

## Project planning and execution

The project will be divided in 3 milestones. See "issues" tab for more info and detailed planning of each milestone.

Each milestone will be presented through vendor's test servers, and once accepted by customer, the code will be checked
in to GitHub as a deliverable, and funds will be released through freelancer.com.
